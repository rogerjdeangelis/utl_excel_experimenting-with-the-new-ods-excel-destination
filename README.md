Experimenting with the new ODS EXCEL Destination    Good Programmers write there own code, great ones steal.   This is stolen stuff from all over the internet, thanks all of you.   Special thanks to Chris Hemedinger and Eric Gebhart    1. Has examples of style elements, inline tags, textdecoration,      tagattr, rotated headings, data superscripts, data subscripts,      autofilters, froxen headers, ods text, titles, footnotes,      heading superscripts and heading subscripts.   2. Creates two workbooks with one sheet in each workbook.   3. Shows two methods to add 'DATA' sheets to either workbook.   4. Has a macro to copy sheets from one workbook to another.      The sheets can have graphs, data, formulas.. or combinations      and will be added(cloned) to the second workbook.
